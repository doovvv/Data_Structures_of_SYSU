An update from the Forums Council for June 2016
New Ubuntu Members via forums contributions
The Forum Council is proud to announce two new Ubuntu memberships obtained through forum contributions.

Please welcome our newest Members, Rex Bouwense and vasa1. You can see Rex Bouwenseâ€™s application thread here and vasa1's application thread here.

They both have been long time contributors and have always showed sustained and helpful contributions to the forums.

If you have been a contributor to the forums and wish to apply to Ubuntu Membership, all you have to do is to put together a wiki and Launchpad pages, sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct and follow the process outlined in the Ubuntu Membership via Forums contributions wiki page.
If, due to the present community wiki lock down, you got stuck and thus unable to set up your own wiki pages, please feel free to get in touch with a member of the staff, through a PM in the forums, and ask for help regarding it.

Should you wish to add items to the Forums Council agenda here is the link.
