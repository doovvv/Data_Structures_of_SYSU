[21:17] corburn +1
[21:17] toddc   hi corburn
[21:17] Siph0n  i love the "Add to Google Calendar" buttons !
[21:18] toddc   Do we want to do a 12.10 Release party?
[21:18] toddc   October 18 is the release date but we could do it on the 20th at the server installfest or as a separate event?
[21:19] toddc   I had been thinking a Ubuntu Geeknick (Picnic/BBQ) At Tempe Town Lake they have WIFI
[21:19] toddc   and power at the picnic tables
[21:19] toddc   think about it
[21:20] MikeofMany      toddc, could be good, and cooler in Oct .
[21:20] _ericcc Only at a linux picnic would consideration of power and wifi be a necessity
[21:20] toddc   I think it would be fun and could draw family groups also
[21:21] _ericcc Tempe offers beer permits, just fyi
[21:21] toddc   +1
[21:21] toddc   but I think they are like 50.00
[21:21] spinrage        sounds like a good idea. If it's on the weekend, I might be able to make it.
[21:22] toddc   Sat was the the OCt 20
[21:22] _ericcc Eh, either way, I'm game.
[21:22] toddc   Do we want to do a global Jam again? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam/
[21:22] toddc   September 7th thru 9th are the recommended dates to hold one
[21:23] MikeofMany      +1 Sat
[21:23] toddc   A bit late to plan but we could invade the tagcose event and work in the corner
[21:24] toddc   MikeofMany: which oct 20 or global jam
[21:24] MikeofMany      toddc, the oct 20 bbq idea, the global jam could be cool, just not sure I would have anything to contrib
[21:25] toddc   it is just testing live 12.10 for issues for the global Jam
[21:25] MikeofMany      ahhh
[21:26] toddc   I will start planning for the release party then and try to show up at the tagcose event incase anyone else wants to help
[21:27] toddc   I will check with plug also to see if they have a interest in the release party
[21:27] MikeofMany      sounds like a plan toddc
[21:27] toddc   since I live in tempe I should check out wifi first
[21:28] toddc   and if anyone wants to help in planning from there let me know we will need coolers charcoal ect
[21:28] toddc   xHans if you are here do you have any news for us?

[21:32] _ericcc Hi neonetninja, from a newcomer
[21:33] NeoNetNinja     hello _ericcc
[21:33] NeoNetNinja     welcome!
[21:33] toddc   NeoNetNinja: want to tell every one where you are at!!
[21:33] NeoNetNinja     sure
[21:33] NeoNetNinja     Native Tucsonan...
[21:33] NeoNetNinja     that pretty much explains everything...
[21:33] NeoNetNinja     lol
[21:33] toddc   but I call dibs on first visit to you
[21:34] NeoNetNinja     kk
[21:34] NeoNetNinja     I'm an online (non-traditional) student at UAT...
[21:34] NeoNetNinja     working toward a BS in Net-Sec
[21:34] NeoNetNinja     Love Ubuntu
[21:34] toddc   four active members in Tucson now we need to get the ubuntu hour running down there
[21:34] NeoNetNinja     Ubuntu Server
[21:35] NeoNetNinja     and kicking some bash!
[21:35] NeoNetNinja     My Fingerprint reader is working on Precise in my Sys76 lappy...
[21:35] NeoNetNinja     it works to auth with sudo in Term!
[21:35] NeoNetNinja     <3 it!
[21:35] MikeofMany      NeoNetNinja, awesome out of box?
[21:36] NeoNetNinja     Just an install of FingerGUI
[21:36] toddc   Damm first class all the way
[21:36] NeoNetNinja     but yeah pretty much
[21:36] NeoNetNinja     no tweaking at all
[21:36] NeoNetNinja     it works for log on as well
[21:37] NeoNetNinja     I'm building a Ubuntu Server based NAS and actually wanted to know if any of you have experience with Webmin and/or Amanda?
[21:37] NeoNetNinja     Or...
[21:37] NeoNetNinja     I was thinking Vsftpd...
[21:37] NeoNetNinja     if it can act as a client too to backup to the cloud
[21:38] NeoNetNinja     Amazon has a new, really affordable, backup service called Glacier and I know Amanda does that
[21:38] toddc   webmin is a bit old I use Zentyal
[21:38] NeoNetNinja     but I also have an FTP account through onlinestoragesolution.com that's really good too that may be able to do Rsync as well...
[21:39] toddc   want to learn puppet next
[21:39] NeoNetNinja     Or...
[21:39] NeoNetNinja     Possibly Deja Dup for both client and server?
[21:39] NeoNetNinja     any thoughts?
[21:39] toddc   NeoNetNinja: we are just completeing a Proxmox VM server as a team project
[21:40] NeoNetNinja     so it would client >> server >> cloud
[21:40] NeoNetNinja     cool
[21:40] NeoNetNinja     I'll check it out
[21:41] toddc   we will be doing some cloud work on our own we are looking again at eyeos
[21:41] NeoNetNinja     I liked Amanda because of the cross platform client support...
[21:41] NeoNetNinja     nice!
[21:41] toddc   and will offer accounts when ready but only have 500gb ATM
[21:42] NeoNetNinja     but thought it would probably require a bit more maintenance...
[21:42] NeoNetNinja     nice!
[21:42] toddc   and we are collecting hardware to build a bigger better one in the near future
[21:42] MikeofMany      very cool
[21:42] NeoNetNinja     what file system does it use/support?
[21:42] NeoNetNinja     ZFS?
[21:44] NeoNetNinja     do you have a host?
[21:44] toddc   should be simple to admin ---debian host ext4 ATM ZFS may be used for the nest version but it was voted down due to several issuses
[21:44] NeoNetNinja     or is it local?
[21:44] toddc   ipcop handles the internal firewall routing---at our DATA center
[21:44] NeoNetNinja     ext4 is good too of course
[21:45] NeoNetNinja     nice
[21:45] NeoNetNinja     in Phx?
[21:45] toddc   I /we will have specs and pictures up this week(I hope)
